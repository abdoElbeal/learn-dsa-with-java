## 🧭 How to Use This Repository  

1. **Choose a Topic Folder** (e.g. `/04-arrays/` or `/17-greedy/`).  
2. Inside each folder, start with its `README.md` — this file teaches you the **concepts** with visuals, notes, and intuition.  
3. Then explore:
   - 🧩 `problems/` → Markdown files containing the problem statements.
   - 💡 `solutions/` → Java-based solutions with clear explanations and complexity analysis.
   - ⚙️ `implementation/` → Core code implementations (e.g., Stack, Queue, Binary Tree, etc.).
4. **Try to solve each problem first** before checking its solution — train your brain to think like a developer.
5. Keep track of your progress by marking completed problems (✅).

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy  

> “Don’t just memorize algorithms — understand **why** they work and **when** to use them.”

This repository focuses on:  
- Building **intuition** instead of rote memorization.  
- Teaching how to **analyze** time and space complexity like an engineer.  
- Demonstrating **clean code practices** using Java.  
- Guiding you step-by-step from **theory ➜ implementation ➜ problem-solving**.  

Every concept is connected to real-world use cases and coding interview patterns.

## 🧩 Problem Format Example  

Each problem appears as two Markdown files:  

```

problems/
└── 11-factorial-trailing-zeros.md     # The question statement
solutions/
└── 11-factorial-trailing-zeros.md     # The Java solution + explanation

```

✅ Each solution file includes:  
- The **Java code**  
- The **intuitive explanation**  
- **Time & Space Complexity**  
- Possible **optimizations**  

---

## 💻 Tech Used  

- **Language:** Java (JDK 17+)  
- **Editor Recommendation:** VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA  
- **File Format:** `.md` for explanations, `.java` for implementations
